             <p class="me">My childhood dream was to be the first woman NBA player. After reaching a peak height of  5’5” I decided to change tacks -- using her brain seemed the wiser career choice. <br> I'm a software engineer who craves an inclusive, culturally diverse work environment where teams work smart and play always.<br/>
            <br/> I want to make things, that make a difference.</p>
