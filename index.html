             <p class="me">Atasha Potter’s childhood dream was to be the first woman NBA player. After reaching a peak height of  5’5” she decided to change tacks -- using her brain seemed the wiser career choice. <br> She's a software engineer who craves an inclusive, culturally diverse work environment where teams work smart and play always.<br/>
            <br/> She wants to make things, that make a difference.</p>
